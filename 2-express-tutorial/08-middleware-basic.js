/**
 * Middleware in ExpressJS
 * are functions that execute during the request to server.
 * They have access to request/response objects.
 * Functionality = Sky's the Limit
 * Docu: "Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
 * the response object (res),
 * and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
 * The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
 * Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
 * Execute any code.
 * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
 * End the request-response cycle.
 * Call the next middleware function in the stack.
